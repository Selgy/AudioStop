# AudioStop for Premiere Pro

AudioStop is an extension for Adobe Premiere Pro that automatically pauses the audio from selected applications (such as Chrome or Spotify) when you press "Play" in Premiere Pro and restores the audio when you press "Pause". This ensures that only your project’s audio is audible while editing.

**Available only on Windows**

## Key Features

- **Automatic App Muting**: During playback in Premiere Pro, selected applications are automatically muted. The audio is restored when playback is stopped.
- **Customizable Delay**: You can adjust the delay before the audio returns after stopping playback.
- **Script Toggle**: If you don’t want this automation to be active at all times, you can disable the script directly from the system tray icon.
